A small line editor for RISCOS - PICO

There is a limited choice of editor for RISCOS which do not require the desktop.  You can use the ARMBE editor built into BASIC and then save files as text only with out the lines using LISTO or is it SAVEO Ive forgoten at this particular momenet. 

But this is a half working editor that I made which was an attempt to build something like EDLIN that came with the original MS-DOS
